- The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers | science


# CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression)
to identify and monitor the activity (transcription initiation frequency) of **transcription start sites (TSS)** at single base-pair resultion acorss the genome

# MNase-seq (micrococal nuclease digestion followed by sequencing)
to measure **nucleosome occupancy** in the human genome

  - chromatin
    - closed : inactive
    - open : active (bounded by TF --> transcription)
  - ATAC-seq
    1. Tn5 transposase gain assess to open/accessible region of genome
    2. tagmentation : transposase insert known DNA seqences (adaptor) into open region
    3. libraries are amplified and sequenced
  - insert size disclose nucleosome position
  - footprint (a deep notch of ATAC-seq) : the presence of DNA-binding protein at each site
