# Drug discovery (윤태영 대표, Oscotec)
- reductionism in science to technology
  - observations --> (deconstruct) principles --> (reconstruct) applications
  - plants --> chemistry (extract chemicals) --> drug
- post-modern drug discovery
  - gene : gene therapy (antisense, RNAi, mRNA, CRISPR, etc)
  - protein : biologics (proteins, antibodies, etc), small molecules
  - cell/gene therapies : stem cells, CART-T, mRNA, small molecules, etc
  - Tissue/organ : regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, etc
- Drug Discovery is Target validation
  - hypothesis : The disease is caused by gene and its target .
  - drug :  hit the drug target

##sequencing
- whole genome sequencing vs exon sequencing
  - **Whole Genome Sequencing** sequences the complete DNA of an organism. In the case of a human this corresponds to about three billion base pairs of DNA. Whole genome sequencing entails sequencing all coding (exons) and noncoding (intron) nuclear DNA as well as mitochondrial DNA. This allows researchers to generate large quantities of data, which can then be analyzed.
  - The exome makes up only 1.5% of the whole human genome, however ALL protein coding genes are found in the exome. Since most genetic disorders are correlated with mutations in protein coding genes, most physicians and scientists who use sequencing technologies for diagnostic purposes start with an analysis of the exome. Exome sequencing and analysis typically takes less time than whole genome sequencing at less than half the cost.
