# Cancer evolution
## terminology
- genome stability : 
  - microsatellite instability (MSI) : mutations/epigenetic silencing of mismatch repair gene -> DNA mismatch repair X -> somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), small indels
  - chromosomal instability (CIN) : aneuploid, accumulate somatic strctural variants (SVs ; genomic rearrangements) -> copy number variations (CNVs)
- molecular time
- hypodiploid
- hyperdiploid

  - On average, cancer genomes contained 4~5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements. However, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified.
  - Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution.
